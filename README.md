# ScpSite76Plugin
Plugin/Map for SCP: Secret Laboratory.

Requirement:
1. Exiled framework.
2. MER plugin. https://github.com/Michal78900/MapEditorReborn

Notification:
1. This plugin's map doesn't have Escape(Class-D, scientist) function in vanila, you can add it by yourself.
2. I used helicopter&chaos car made by Moklman.
3. I recommend to set config of MER's "schematic_block_spawn_delay" to -1. It will help map build faster.
4. In low-detailed version schematic, console 3th floor is deleted. (Becuase it cause serious lag.)
